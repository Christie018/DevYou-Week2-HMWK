The following activity is crafted to provide us with practical experience regarding the basic Git workflow we'll engage in daily while coding. Additionally, it offers a collaborative environment to navigate through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

I expect to learn more about how to code full scale web site and applications. I'd like to get more experience with front end coding languages and frameworks such as Java Script and React.js in order to have a better idea of where potential vulnerabilities may lie when going through web application penetration testing. As a bug bounty hunter, the main things I expect to learn from this course include understanding how websites work and interact with the backend code so that I'll be able to find web site and application vulnerabilities easier.

I'm  looking forward to get more familiar with all aspects of Github and learn more about coding. working on these 
projects will allow me to understand the dynamics of working  with a coding and web  developing team, the processes 
they go through and to see the final results at the end.
