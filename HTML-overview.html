        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents displayed in a web browser. HTML defines the meaning and structure of the web content. This language is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage, they render the documents into web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML, images and other objects such forms and tables may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags can directly introduce content into the page. Other HTML tags, like surround and provide information about document text. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
